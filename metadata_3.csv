Total alkalinity is determined in a whole water sample by potentiometric titration of a sample aliquot with a standard solution of sulphuric acid. This method employs an automated titrator which makes incremental additions of titrant to the sample and plots a titration curve. The titration curve is a plot of pH vs volume of titrant added. The endpoint of the titration is determined by analysis of the titration curve using a first derivative function to find the inflection point (curve changes from concave to convex or vice versa). The inflection point represents the stoichiometric equivalence point for the neutralization of the carbonates and other bases present. The total alkalinity is given by the equation F*X, where X= ml of acid needed to titrate to the inflection point and F is a factor derived from standardization of the acid.

The sample aliquot is incubated, at 20°C for five days under proper conditions. The procedure depends on the nature of the sample. After aeration of the samples to bring the dissolved oxygen content to saturation, one of the following three variations can be used, depending on the type of samples to be analysed:~r~n 1 - The direct method: If the BOD does not exceed 7 mg/L, then the BOD is determined directly by measuring the dissolved oxygen content of the water, before and after a five days incubation period at 20°C.~r~n 2 - Unseeded dilution method: For waters having BOD values greater than 7 mg/L: appropriate sample aliquots are diluted using dilution water, saturated with oxygen, and the oxygen content is determined before and after the incubation period. A minimum of three dilutions per sample, with a final content between 40% and 70% of the original oxygen concentration, will give best results.~r~n 3 - Seeded dilution method: It is extremely important that the conditions be appropriate for the living organisms to function unhindered during the incubation period. Toxic substances should be absent, and necessary nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, should be present. It is important that a mixed group of organisms (called ""seed"") should be present during the test. The dilution water is seeded with the proper kind and number of organisms and saturated with oxygen (overnight) before the BOD test.~r~n Siphon the diluted sample to fill three BOD bottles; one for incubation (five days), one for the determination of the dissolved oxygen content (measured and record as ""initial DO"") and the other for the determination of the immediate dissolved oxygen demand (IDOD), after a 15 minutes incubation period. A minimum of three dilutions per sample, with a final content between 40% and 70% of the original oxygen concentration, will give best results.~r~n Use a calibrated oxygen meter to measure the oxygen concentrations before and after incubation.~r~n Interference: Many synthetic organic components from industrial wastewaters are not biodegradable without adding seeding water due to the toxic effect or the absence or deficiency of appropriate microorganisms. Sample containing residual Cl2, that is acidic or alkaline, must be neutralized to pH=7, and sometimes titrated with a Na2S2O3 solution to liberate the chloride from solution. A sample, containing sulphide, sulphite and/or ferrous ions, creates an immediate demand, corrected by the IDOD.~r~n The method detection limit is 1 mg/L."

A sample is preserved in the field at 4°C and the analysis started within 4 hours. A sample is incubated at 20°C under proper conditions. Comparison of the dissolved oxygen content at the beginning and the end of the incubation period is the measure of the Biochemical Oxygen Demand. The procedure depends on the nature of the sample.

The iodide is titrated with a standardized sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3), using starch as an indicator.~r~n Interference: Many synthetic organic components from industrial wastewaters are not biodegradable without adding seeding water. Sample containing residual Cl2, that is acidic or alkaline, must be neutralized to pH=7 and titrated with Na2S2O3 solution.

Place a sterile absorbing pad in each culture dish and saturate with M-FC medium.

If absent, re-incubate for another 24 hours. The absence of acidic reaction or gas formation constitutes a negative test. Gently shake or rotate the tubes/bottles to re-suspend the organisms. With a sterile loop, transfer one or more loopfuls of culture to the fermentation tube containing brilliant green lactose bile broth (or insert a sterile applicator into the culture, quickly remove and insert to the bottom of fermentation tube containing the broth.
